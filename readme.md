## Learning Babel

The goal of this project is to be able to explain how babel is used, in a basic CLI project.

I've used the Babel setup instructions as a guide.

[Babel Setup](https://babeljs.io/setup#installation)

### How to Install

Install dependencies:

```console
$ npm install
```

### How to Run

Run the build script:

```console
$ npm run build
```

### Learning Notes

- The most basic setup involves just a config file (.babelrc), which specifies which presets to use, and a script or command to run babel.
- package-lock.json should be commited (ie not ignored)
- "git reset" can be used to unstage files.
